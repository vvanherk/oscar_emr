This document outlines how we intend to use maven in the oscar projects. For the most part our usage of maven will be normal/standard.

----------
local_repo
----------
In our projects we may have a /local_repo directory.

The purpose of this directory is to be a maven repository on the filesystem and revisioned. Only files which aren't readily available in repoX.maven.org should be put in here. Most notably this includes libraries from associated projects like for example, the oscar project may contain client stubs for the integrator web services, the integrator_client_stubs.jar would then be a candidate for the local_repo.

The main reason we want to do this is to allow people to work in their projects in relative isolation. i.e. the majority of people currently only work on oscar, we don't want them to have to clone and build all the dependencies just to work on oscar. These dependencies are quite numerous, it directly includes the myoscar server, integrator server, signature_pad, utils, and oscar_plugins, it then transitively includes the health number registry via the integrator as well. This would be a nightmare for some one just wanting to do a change in oscar to checkout and build all these dependencies.

Another reason is because we don't want everyone to have to do a "mvn install" for all non-repo.maven.org available libraries on all their machines. This is often error prone and time consuming, by putting them in the local_repo, only the person who initially caused the need for the library needs to "mvn install" this once after that everyone gets it automatically and the library is also archived and revisioned. 

-------------
code checking
-------------
By default most code validations should be on for the main build. i.e. junit tests, pmd checks, checkstyle checks, jsp compiles.

Developers can skip these tests during their regular development via "mvn -Dmaven.test.skip=true -Dcheckstyle.skip=true -Dpmd.skip=true package" which developers may wish to create and alias for. Having said that, developers should try to do the full build with complete checks before committing.
